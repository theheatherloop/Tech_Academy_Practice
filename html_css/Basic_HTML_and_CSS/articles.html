					<h2>In History</h2>
					<p>Ancient Greek and Roman sculptures were originally painted with bright colors;
					<br>they only appear white today because the original pigments have deteriorated.
					<br>Some well-preserved statues still bear traces of their original coloration

					<h2>Microwaves</h2>
					<p>Microwave ovens do not cause cancer, as microwave radiation is non-ionizing,
					<br>and therefore does not have the cancer risks associated with ionizing radiation
					<br>such as X-rays. No studies have found that microwave radiation causes cancer,
					even with exposure levels far greater than normal radiation leakage.</p>
