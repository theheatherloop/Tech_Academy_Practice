		<p>The Savannah cat is the largest of the domestic cat breeds, and grow to be about the size of a medium dog.<br>
		On April 7, 1986, Judee Frank crossbred a male serval, belonging to Suzi Woods, with a Siamese domestic cat to produce the first Savannah cat (named Savannah).<br>
		In 2001 The International Cat Association<sup>&copy;</sup>(TICA<sup>&copy;</sup>) accepted the Savannah as a new registered breed. 
		In May 2012, TICA<sup>&copy;</sup> accepted it as a championship breed.</p>

		<p>The cats are known for their loyalty, and they will follow their owners around the house. They can also be trained to walk on a leash and to fetch.<br>
		An often-noted trait of the Savannah is its jumping ability, which complements its natural tendency to seek out high places. Some Savannahs can leap about<br>
		8 feet (2.5 m) high from a standing position. Many Savannah cats do not fear water, and will play or even immerse themselves in water.<br></p>
